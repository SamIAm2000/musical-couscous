    <h3>Inspiration</h5>
      <p>
        The sound I was trying to recreate was the Star Wars Laser Blaster
        sound. There are many versions of the sound in the movies as each gun
        has a slightly different quality, but they all share the "pew pew" sound
        that starts high pitched and then ends low.
      </p>

      <p>
        I looked into how to sound was created for the movies and found that the
        foley artists used the sound of hitting a long metal power line (or
        radio line?) with a mallet. The physics behind it is called dispersion:
        since different frequencies travel at different speeds through air and
        metal, we hear a change in pitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        To recreate this sound, I first looked at spectrograms of different
        versions of the sound.

      The first image is the
      <a href="https://youtu.be/1o_mKDJCcGY?si=4BGabufS7w04u2oC"
        >sound of blasters</a
      >
      from the original Star Wars movies.
      <br />
      <br />
      The second image is the sound of a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl0wIdGxfbQ"
        >power line being hit</a
      >.

      <h3>How I made it</h5>
      I saw that the sounds all started with a high frequency that quickly
      dropped to almost 0 Hz exponentially. This inspired me to use the a sine
      wave oscillator that started with a high freqeuncy and then use the
      <em>exponentialRampToValueAtTime()</em>
      function to ramp down the frequency.
      <br />
      <br />
      I first started with one oscillator imitating the second image and the
      sound was already pretty close. I really liked how the original Star Wars
      blaster sounds had a low twang while they were being fired. From observing
      the spectrograms, there were multiple bands of frequencies that were
      lowered consecutively, so I added more oscillators to the sound and
      lowered them to 0 at different times. The result was a sound that was very
      close to the original.
      <br />
      <br />
      I also added some reverb because it sounded cool.
      <br />
      <br />
      Below is the spectrogram of the sound I created and the audio signal flow
      graph. It's just simple additive synthesis with reverb, but it works. The
      ADSR envelopes for each of the oscillators took more trial and error to
      get the nuancies of the sound right.

      <h3> Future thoughts </h3>
        More oscillators? More bass? More reverb?
